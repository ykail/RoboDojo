<p align="center"><em>Overview of RoboDojo. RoboDojo unifies efficient simulation evaluation and reproducible real-world testing for generalist robot manipulation, covering 42 simulation tasks, 18 real-world tasks, heterogeneous parallel simulation, RoboDojo-RealEval, XPolicyLab, and a continuously updated leaderboard.</em></p>

> RoboDojo is **eval-only** in this release: it provides the simulator client, benchmark tasks, asset/config validation, and result artifacts. Policy implementations and servers remain outside RoboDojo, normally in [XPolicyLab](https://github.com/XPolicyLab/XPolicyLab/blob/main/README.md) or an explicitly integrated repository such as Kai0.

- 🌐 **Unified sim-and-real benchmark** — 42 simulation tasks and 18 real-world tasks across 3 robot embodiments for generalist robot manipulation.
- 🧭 **Five capability dimensions** — Generalization, Memory, Precision, Long-Horizon, and Open, designed to probe different skills rather than simple object or layout reskins.
- 🧗 **Challenging by design** — intentionally hard, diverse, long-horizon tasks that expose failures hidden by simpler benchmarks.
- ⚡ **Heterogeneous parallel simulation** — runs different tasks, scenes, and processes concurrently on Isaac Sim for fast, scalable feedback.
- 🧱 **Physically grounded assets** — rigid, articulated, and deformable objects in a single configuration-driven scene.
- 🤖 **Integrate once, evaluate everywhere** — [XPolicyLab](https://github.com/XPolicyLab/XPolicyLab/blob/main/README.md) unifies 40+ policies behind one interface for both simulation and real-world runs.
- 📊 **Reproducible & leaderboard-ready** — seed-controlled layouts and one-command `summarize` aggregation into a leaderboard table.

## 🔌 Policy Integration

Most policies live in [XPolicyLab](https://github.com/XPolicyLab/XPolicyLab/blob/main/README.md), which owns policy structure, dependencies, checkpoint layout, and server behavior. For that runtime, RoboDojo assumes a policy directory provides:

```text
XPolicyLab/policy/<POLICY_NAME>/eval.sh
XPolicyLab/policy/<POLICY_NAME>/deploy.yml
```

`eval.sh` starts the policy server and calls back into RoboDojo through `scripts/eval_policy.sh`; `deploy.yml` declares the server host, port, action mode, and policy-specific runtime settings.

Kai0 Pi0.5 also has an optional direct integration through the versioned
`robodojo-policy-v1` protocol. Kai0 remains the owner of its model server and
environment; RoboDojo owns only the simulator-side client and adapter. See the
[Kai0 Pi0.5 setup guide](docs/KAI0_PI05_SETUP.md) for installation and commands,
and the [integration guide](docs/KAI0_PI05_INTEGRATION.md) for architecture and
protocol details.

## 🏆 Leaderboard

View live rankings on the [RoboDojo Leaderboard](https://robodojo-benchmark.com/leaderboard).

**Simulation.** The full evaluation stack is open source, so you can debug locally and iterate on scores. Official RoboDojo-endorsed listings are submitted through the cloud evaluation pipeline with anti-cheating verification.

**Real world.** Real-robot leaderboard entries are accepted through the same cloud evaluation process; see the public documentation for protocol, rules, and submission details.
